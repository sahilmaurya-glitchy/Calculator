Simple Calculator Project
This is a simple calculator project created as a learning exercise using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The motivation behind this project was to gain a better understanding of web development fundamentals and to practice problem-solving skills.

Features
Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Percentage calculation: Easily calculate percentages of numbers.
Dark and light mode: Switch between dark and light themes for better visibility and user preference.
Challenges Faced
During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered, especially as a beginner. However, by leveraging problem-solving skills and determination, these challenges were overcome without resorting to external resources.

Future Plans
In the future, I plan to enhance the functionality of this calculator by adding more advanced features such as:

Square root, cube root, and other mathematical functions.
Trigonometric functions such as cosine and sine.
Memory functionality for storing and recalling previous calculations.
Usage
To use the calculator, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can perform basic arithmetic operations and utilize the percentage calculation feature. Additionally, you can switch between dark and light modes for improved readability.
